# Making a basic laser enclosure (no design experience needed)
1. [Open up a box generator.](https://en.makercase.com/#/basicbox)
    1. We recommend using a thickness of 0.125 inches.
    1. Adding fingers will make assembly easier. Change the "Edge Joints" to fingers.
    1. Download files as svg. No need to change any of the other settings.
1. Ask a member of staff to invite you to the Glowforge system. You will need to sign up for an account, but it is free. Please skip any features that ask for a credit card.
1. "Create a new design" in the [Glowforge interface](app.glowforge.com)

1. In the Glowforge interface, click and drag those holes around on the generated box pieces to place them where you want them.
1. You will need to set the material to "Medium Draftboard" in the top left of the Glowforge interface. You may have to search using the search box.

# Dimensions
The main board outline is 2.2 inches wide by 2.1 inches deep x 1.6 mm tall. Please pardon the mixed units, but that's just how PCB design is.

# Models
The 3D model for the carrier board (in both Fusion 360 format and STL) are located above. If you are not proficient in Fusion 360, the STL file can be used with TinkerCAD to add features. It will be tough to 3D print something in time, but it could be ready by the time you get back for the happy hour.
