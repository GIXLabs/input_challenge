# Dimensions
The main board outline is 2.2 inches wide by 2.1 inches deep x 1.6 mm tall. Please pardon the mixed units, but that's just how PCB design is.

# Models
The 3D model for the carrier board (in both Fusion 360 format and STL) are located above. If you are not proficient in Fusion 360, the STL file can be used with TinkerCAD to add features.
