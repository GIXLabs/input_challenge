# Context
On Visit Day there were 9 people that were initially divided into three groups of two and one group of three. One person had to leave to catch her flight and thus her teammate was moved to join another group of two.

Each group was able to come up with a user group and scenario as well as create a physical prototype.

Two people pulled out their phones for very short times (no more than 20 minutes apiece over the duration of the event).

Two groups used the laser cutters, one of which had never done laser cutting or Inkscape. The other group skipped the tutorial and asked Kevin directly for help loading the file into the laser.

# Linda Notes
- Did well finding the resources and coming up with different solutions. 
- Felt a bit like we dropped them into an environment but then left them to their own devices. 
- The time could have been more structured with check-ins, perhaps with members of the crew. 
- Liked that it was scaleable with stretch goals.

# Kevin Notes
- Groups only tried the easier extra credit assignments (editing a single line of code or lasercutting).
    - Perhaps a better documented extra credit section would encourage more exploration.
- As it was currently is envisioned, a single person could run an event with likely twice as many groups.
- Code could be simplified with classes to make a general purpose controller object, which would make it easier to edit.
